- Can be added if needed

### Suggested Future Enhancements

1. **File Upload Integration:**
   - Add Google Drive picker for image/video upload
   - Auto-upload to Box.com via API
   - Generate Box.com share links automatically

2. **Rich Text Editor:**
   - Add formatting toolbar for post copy
   - Preview mode for formatted text

3. **Duplicate Post Function:**
   - Click existing post ‚Üí "Duplicate" button
   - Pre-fills form with same data

4. **Draft Auto-Save:**
   - Save form data to localStorage
   - Resume if user accidentally closes modal

5. **Batch Post Creation:**
   - Create multiple posts at once
   - Useful for content calendars

## Troubleshooting

- Check Execution Log in Apps Script for errors

### Post Not Saving
- Check browser console for errors
- Check Apps Script Execution Log
- Verify `createPostFromUI` function has permissions
- Check that Posts and Post_Platforms sheets exist with correct headers

### Subsidiaries Not Loading
- Verify Subsidiaries sheet exists
- Check that selected client has subsidiaries with Status = "Active"
- Check `getClientSubsidiaries()` function logs

### Post Created but Not Showing on Calendar
- Check that scheduled date is in the currently viewed month
- Check that post status is in the allowed list in `getAllPosts()`
- Refresh page manually if auto-refresh didn't work
