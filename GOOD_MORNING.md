## ⚙️ Backend Implementation

### New Functions Created

**DataService.js:**
1. `getFormOptions()` - Loads all dropdown data (clients, platforms, categories, users)
2. `getClientSubsidiaries(clientId)` - Gets subsidiaries for selected client
3. `createPostFromUI(postData)` - Main post creation function:
   - Generates new POST-XXX ID
   - Maps form data to Posts sheet columns
   - Handles all field types (text, dates, dropdowns, multi-selects)
   - Sets Created_By, Created_Date automatically
   - Status = "Draft" or "Internal_Review" based on button clicked

4. `createPostPlatforms(postId, platforms)` - Creates Post_Platforms records:
   - Generates PP-XXX IDs for each platform
   - Stores media URLs and media types
   - Links to parent post

### Data Flow

```
User clicks "Create Post"
  → Modal opens
  → Loads form options from backend
  → User fills form
  → User selects client
    → Subsidiaries load dynamically
  → User checks platforms
    → Media fields appear for each
  → User clicks "Save" or "Submit"
    → Client-side validation
    → If valid → Send to backend
      → createPostFromUI() saves to Posts
      → createPostPlatforms() saves to Post_Platforms
      → If "Submit" → submitForInternalReview() creates approvals
    → Success message shows
    → Calendar refreshes
    → New post appears!
```

**Phase 3: Post Detail View** (Logical next step)
